        "In light of recent news from Apple, facial recognition technology is now the talk of the town. Ranging from privacy concerns to a curious boyfriend unlocking his girlfriend’s phone while she sleeps. The first commercial application of 3D facial recognition means that biometric technology is advancing at a staggering rate but so is the ability to hack or fool facial recognition tech.\n",
        "\n",
        "Today, 99% of the infrastructure scattered around the world consists of 2D cameras capable of running advanced facial recognition software and it will likely be years before a physical overhaul to 3D cameras takes place. Hackers, hobbyists, educators and the like have been developing creative ways to either fool or hide from 2D face recognition in a perpetually innovative game of cat and mouse.\n",
        "\n",
        "The introduction of 3D recognition will give way to an entirely new thought process of how to beat an incredibly advanced technology, and also raise some questions as to how and by whom it will be used. The fight is futile as the effort exerted to trick this technology is better spent working with the facial recognition companies to enforce acceptable regulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, I question the intention of these types of face recognition-fooling solutions. Are they for bad actors hoping to sneak away undetected? Are they for people who are concerned about their picture being stored in a massive database (I’d worry more about posting a picture to Facebook…)? Are they to demonstrate the inherent risk of biometric information?\n",
        "\n",
        "The variations that humans have designed to deceive the machine are more likely to make you stand out than blend in. Such as custom makeup, hairstyles, masks, a pair of glasses designed at Carnegie Melon consisting of camouflage patterns or simply wearing a box over your head. Some of them are realistic, but most are just for fun\n",
        "\n",
        "As these techniques improve, so does the technology capable of identifying and training against them resulting in more robust face recognition software. These solutions seem like a great way to protect individuals who are looking to keep their identity hidden for nefarious reasons.\n",
        "A further concern would be detecting an attempt to impersonate an individual by using a picture of their face. With 3D cameras, this type of hack is very difficult to achieve due to the complexity of depth measurements. Facial recognition technology can run liveness detection or use additional hardware for heat sensing, both of which are capable of being tricked to a degree as seen with Samsung and Google.\n",
        "\n",
        "The availability of public facial images is far more concerning due to the ease of which you would be able to render a 3D model from a small set of images and use virtual reality tools to project a face.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the surface, these types of hacks would seem alarming but if gaining access to your phone now is as easy as guessing a 4-digit passcode, society should deem these tolerable risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately it is on facial recognition companies and Trueface to mitigate this risk by being more innovative, detecting consistencies in attacks and training the technology to identify when hacks occur. This game will continue to be played and become significantly more sophisticated with the adoption of 3D facial recognition.\n",

        "\n",
        "To explain how this process works, let me tell you a short story.\n",
        "A Problem in Need of a Creative Solution\n",
        "In the 1870s, newspapers and printers faced a very specific and very costly problem. Photography was a new and exciting medium at the time. Readers wanted to see more pictures, but nobody could figure out how to print images quickly and cheaply.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a newspaper wanted to print an image in the 1870s, they had to commission an engraver to etch a copy of the photograph onto a steel plate by hand. These plates were used to press the image onto the page, but they often broke after just a few uses. This process of photoengraving, you can imagine, was remarkably time consuming and expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "The man who invented a solution to this problem was named Frederic Eugene Ives. He went on to become a trailblazer in the field of photography and held over 70 patents by the end of his career. His story of creativity and innovation, which I will share now, is a useful case study for understanding the 5 key steps of the creative process.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Flash of Insight\n",
        "Ives got his start as a printer’s apprentice in Ithaca, New York. After two years of learning the ins and outs of the printing process, he began managing the photographic laboratory at nearby Cornell University. He spent the rest of the decade experimenting with new photography techniques and learning about cameras, printers, and optics.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 1881, Ives had a flash of insight regarding a better printing technique.\n",
        "\n",
        "“While operating my photostereotype process in Ithaca, I studied the problem of halftone process,” Ives said. “I went to bed one night in a state of brain fog over the problem, and the instant I woke in the morning saw before me, apparently projected on the ceiling, the completely worked out process and equipment in operation.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Ives quickly translated his vision into reality and patented his printing approach in 1881. He spent the remainder of the decade improving upon it. By 1885, he had developed a simplified process that delivered even better results. The Ives Process, as it came to be known, reduced the cost of printing images by 15x and remained the standard printing technique for the next 80 years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alright, now let's discuss what lessons we can learn from Ives about the creative process.\n",
        "\n",
        "In some circles, Ben Hogan is credited with “inventing practice.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Hogan was one of the greatest golfers of the 20th century, an accomplishment he achieved through tireless repetition. He simply loved to practice. Hogan said, “I couldn't wait to get up in the morning so I could hit balls. I'd be at the practice tee at the crack of dawn, hit balls for a few hours, then take a break and get right back to it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "For Hogan, every practice session had a purpose. He reportedly spent years breaking down each phase of the golf swing and testing new methods for each segment. The result was near perfection. He developed one of the most finely-tuned golf swings in the history of the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "His precision made him more like a surgeon than a golfer. During the 1953 Masters, for example, Hogan hit the flagstick on back-to-back holes. A few days later, he broke the tournament scoring record.\n",
        "Audrey Hepburn was an icon.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rising to fame in the 1950s, she was one of the greatest actresses of her era. In 1953, Hepburn became the first actress to win an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for a single performance: her leading role in the romantic comedy Roman Holiday.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even today, over half a century later, she remains one of just 15 people to earn an “EGOT” by winning all four major entertainment awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. By the 1960s, she was averaging more than one new film per year and, by everyone's estimation, she was on a trajectory to be a movie star for decades to come.\n",
        "\n",
        "But then something funny happened: she stopped acting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite being in her 30s and at the height of her popularity, Hepburn basically stopped appearing in films after 1967. She would perform in television shows or movies just five times during the rest of her life.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, she switched careers. She spent the next 25 years working tirelessly for UNICEF, the arm of the United Nations that provides food and healthcare to children in war-torn countries. She performed volunteer work throughout Africa, South America, and Asia.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hepburn's first act was on stage. Her next act was one of service. In December 1992, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her efforts, which is the highest civilian award of the United States.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will return to her story in a moment.\n",
        "The ultimate productivity hack is saying no.\n",
        "\n",
        "Not doing something will always be faster than doing it. This statement reminds me of the old computer programming saying, “Remember that there is no code faster than no code.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The same philosophy applies in other areas of life. For example, there is no meeting that goes faster than not having a meeting at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is not to say you should never attend another meeting, but the truth is that we say yes to many things we don't actually want to do. There are many meetings held that don't need to be held. There is a lot of code written that could be deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "How often do people ask you to do something and you just reply, “Sure thing.” Three days later, you're overwhelmed by how much is on your to-do list. We become frustrated by our obligations even though we were the ones who said yes to them in the first place.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's worth asking if things are necessary. Many of them are not, and a simple “no” will be more productive than whatever work the most efficient person can muster.\n",
        "\n",
        "But if the benefits of saying no are so obvious, then why do we say yes so often?\"\"\""

        "In this assignment, four extractive summarization algorithms were applied: TF-IDF, TextRank, LSA, and LexRank. Before performing summarization, all documents were preprocessed by converting text to lowercase, removing non-alphabetic characters, and tokenizing sentences and words. This preprocessing step ensures that the algorithms focus on meaningful lexical information rather than noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "The TF-IDF summarization method selects sentences containing high-weighted words that frequently appear in a document but are less common across sentences. This makes TF-IDF simple and fast, but also somewhat rigid. It tends to extract sentences with repeated terms rather than sentences that best represent the overall context. In the long texts (text1 and text4), TF-IDF produced summaries that were narrow in scope and focused mostly on sentences containing technical keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "The TextRank algorithm, which builds a similarity graph between sentences, produced the most coherent summaries. Because it considers sentence-to-sentence relationships, TextRank is better at preserving the global structure of the document. For the longest texts, its summaries presented a logical flow that captured the main ideas more effectively than TF-IDF.\n",
        "\n",
        "The LSA method, which uses latent semantic analysis via singular value decomposition (SVD), produced topic-oriented summaries. LSA emphasizes underlying semantic structure rather than sentence-level importance. As a result, LSA occasionally generated summaries that were short or overly focused on specific themes, particularly in longer documents. However, for shorter documents (text2 and text3), its performance remained stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The LexRank approach, similar to TextRank but based on TF-IDF cosine similarity, produced balanced and concise summaries. It captured central sentences effectively but tended to select fewer sentences than TextRank. In many cases, LexRank favored sentences that reflected the main thematic ideas without redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, TextRank provided the best general summarization quality, capturing both sentence-level relevance and document structure. LSA was best for topic-oriented extraction, TF-IDF was simplest but most limited, and LexRank was stable and concise. Comparing them highlights how algorithmic design influences the type of summary produced."

        "The lexicon-based approach, which assigns scores to words based on a predefined positive–negative dictionary, is simple and transparent. However, it lacks the ability to understand context, sarcasm, negation, or domain-specific meanings. Its results in this assignment were very stable: text1 and text2 were evaluated as neutral because they contain mostly technical or descriptive language, while text3 and text4 were classified as positive due to explicit emotional vocabulary. This reflects the core nature of lexicon methods—they analyze surface-level word polarity, not deeper meaning."

        "Through this assignment, multiple summarization and sentiment analysis algorithms were implemented and compared. The summarization task revealed that different algorithms prioritize different linguistic features: TF-IDF focuses on word frequency, TextRank and LexRank focus on sentence relationships, and LSA focuses on latent topics. TextRank ultimately delivered the most coherent multi-sentence summaries.\n",

        "Together, these findings illustrate how preprocessing, model selection, and algorithmic design shape the outcomes of NLP tasks. Comparing multiple approaches helps deepen our understanding of their strengths and limitations, and demonstrates the importance of choosing the right method depending on the application."
